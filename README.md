# Simple Things On Maps
a list of simple mapping tools for putting things on maps

Often people come to me with some very simple mapping needs: they just want to get some points on a web map, or maybe a few points and polygons. I'm so used to building fairly complicated mapping systems, I don't really know what to suggest for the simple use case. Here is a list of some options, so I know what to suggest next time someone asks. I will keep adding to this list, but I won't always check to see if the older entries on this list still work.

* https://felt.com is a new tool that aims to solve this exact problem, and does it very well!
* If you speak French, https://GoGoCarto.fr looks like a good choice
* Google My Maps is what I used to use all the time. It still kinda works, but it's hard to find: https://www.google.com/mymaps
* https://mapme.com is a newer option, but requires a subscription
* http://CARTO.com (formerly known as CartoDB) is what I used for a long time, but their free plans have changed a while ago
* http://umap.openstreetmap.fr/ comes from the OSM community, I haven't used it much
* http://mapstory.org/ is not the same as [ESRI Story Maps](storymaps.arcgis.com)
* http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html ArcGIS Online, if you create a free "public account". Can also be used in [ESRI Story Maps](storymaps.arcgis.com)
* http://maphubs.com/ lets you upload data or draw new data using OSM's iD editor
* https://maphub.net/ simple tool for creating interactive maps supporting a wide range of basemaps
* https://mapjam.com/
* https://www.mapmakertool.com/free
* http://geojson.io is a quick way to make a GeoJSON, then host it on GitHub.
* The creator of GeoJSON.io now has a new more powerful tool called https://placemark.io
* Mapbox has some sample code to "[Just Add Markers To A Map"](https://twitter.com/Mapbox/status/970760366652297216 ) or "JAMTAM": https://www.mapbox.com/help/marker-playground/

Please add new services to this list, and help me flesh out the ones I have! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
